D-BPP Pipeline: Step-by-Step Workflow

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for running the D-BPP pipeline, from raw data preparation to the final inference of phylogenetic networks and ghost introgression.

1. Data Preparation

a. Sequence Data
Input: Multi-locus sequence alignments or VCF files including both ingroup species and at least one designated outgroup.

Format: Multi-FASTA; ensure sample names are consistent throughout all analyses.

Sequence file format: Multi-FASTA, e.g.
>Sp1
ATGCTAG...
>Sp2
ATGCCAG...
>Sp3
...
>Outgroup
...

If you have VCF files, you can convert them to FASTA format using snp-sites:

snp-sites -v -o vcf.file fasta.file

(software snp-sites: http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/snp-sites/)



b. Species Tree Topologies
Input: Candidate species tree topologies in Newick format (e.g., generated from previous studies or sliding-window analyses).
